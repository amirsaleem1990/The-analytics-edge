    "#### Even' Star Organic Farm was founded in 1997 by Brett Grohsgal, a former chef in Washington DC. The company owns a 104-acre farm in southern Maryland, and grows and sells organic produce. For more information, see Even' Star's Facebook page. This problem describes the business issues faced by Brett, and the data is based on actual observations.\n",
    "#### Brett has decided to grow eight different types of produce: large tomatoes, small tomatoes, watermelon, okra, basil, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, and winter squash. He distributes his produce through three different channels: Restaurants, Community-Supported Agriculture, and Farmers' Markets.\n",
    "#### Initially, he sold exclusively to restuarants. He knows of 20 restaurants that will buy his produce from his connections as a former chef. As his farm expanded, he also started selling his produce at a local farmers' market, where he can command a higher price. Recently, he has also started selling through Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), a program in which individuals pay a \\\\$400 subscription price to get a box of produce each week for 15 weeks. He currently knows of 90 individuals who are interested in buying his produce through the CSA program.\n",
    "#### Brett has a limited amount of produce that he can sell each season, and he needs to decide how much produce to sell through each channel (restaurants, CSA, or farmers' markets)."

    "#### Let's formulate Brett's problem as a linear optimization problem. The spreadsheet EvenStarFarm (ODS) for LibreOffice or OpenOffice, and EvenStarFarm (XLSX) for Microsoft Excel, contains the data for the problem, and has set up the decision variables and objective for you.\n",
    "#### The decision variables in our problem are the number of cases of each type of produce to sell in each channel (there are 24 decision variables). They are highlighted in yellow in the spreadsheet.\n",
    "#### Brett's objective is to maximize total profit (total revenue minus total cost). In the spreadsheet EvenStarFarm, the objective is highlighted in blue.\n",
    "#### To compute the total revenue, we multiply the number of cases of each type of produce distributed in each channel by the price that Brett sells it for. The price of a case of each type of produce in each of the different channels is listed in cells C6:E13 of the spreadsheet.\n",
    "#### The total cost is composed of two parts: a variable cost per client, and an entry cost for being in the particular channel. The entry costs are listed in cells B20:D20.\n",
    "#### To compute the total variable cost for each restaurant client, we use the information that each restaurant client will buy 119 cases of produce during the season. So, the total number of restaurant clients served in a season can be computed as the total number of cases sold to restaurants, divided by 119. (Note that the number of restuarant clients Brett gives produce to could be fractional (like 16.57). This is a simplification we'll make for this problem, so please ignore the fact that this number should be integer. We'll see next week how you can add integer restrictions to an optimization model.)\n",
    "#### To compute the total variable cost for CSA clients, we need to know that each CSA customer will buy \\\\$400 worth of produce during the season. So, the total number of CSA clients served can be computed by dividing the total dollar amount sent to CSA customers by \\\\$400. (Note that the number of CSA clients Brett gives produce to could be fractional (like 16.57). This is a simplification we'll make for this problem, so please ignore the fact that this number should be integer.
